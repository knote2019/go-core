Type is here for the purposes of documentation only. 
It is a stand-in for any Go type, but represents the same type for any given function invocation.
Type1 is here for the purposes of documentation only. 
It is a stand-in for any Go type, but represents the same type for any given function invocation.

The error built-in interface type is the conventional interface for representing an error condition,
with the nil value representing no error.
###:
type error interface {
    Error() string
}

rune is an alias for int32 and is equivalent to int32 in all ways.
It is used, by convention, to distinguish character values from integer values.

uint8 is the set of all unsigned 8-bit integers. Range: 0 through 255.

uintptr is an integer type that is large enough to hold the bit pattern of any pointer.

nil is a predeclared identifier representing the zero value for
a pointer, channel, func, interface, map, or slice type.
